The user will put in a set amount of money, and only after completing the goal would they get their money back.\nThe money doesn't expire though! There's always a chance for the user to finish their goal and earn their money back.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The app itself is designed as a board game-esque fashion, where users start on square one and progressively climb their way up the path until reaching their goal. Each spot represents a documented entry of their goal, and they can view their past record of documentation by clicking on previous spots they were on.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I worked with two UX designers and one other developer to get this prototype out.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`the deliverables`}</h2>\n    <video width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" controls>\n  <source src=\"../../images/centiv/centiv.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    </video>\n    <p>{`Check out the live prototype `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://centiv.netlify.app/\"\n      }}>{`here`}</a>{` or read through our full design process `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://uxfol.io/project/0359a92f/Centiv\"\n      }}>{`here`}</a>{`.\n(Or if you're extra curious, visit the repository `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/wang-er/interaction-team-degree-capstone\"\n      }}>{`here!`}</a>{`)`}</p>\n    <h2>{`a quick overview of research`}</h2>\n    <p>{`For this capstone, we read 100 different research papers, interviewed 12 key audience members and experts – focusing on topics\nabout motivation, social media, gamification, and habit formation.
