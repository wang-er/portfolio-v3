## Northeastern University Association of Gaming Enthusiasts
During my time at [Northeastern University Association of Gaming Enthusiasts](https://gamingnu.wixsite.com/nuage), or Northeastern's board game club, I was asked to design a handful of t-shirts.
We managed to sell over 50+ shirts every year, raising over hundreds of dollars which were used to run club events and fund fun dining and recreational experiences.

## Northeastern senior t-shirt
Every year, Northeastern hosts a contest for the senior class' t-shirt. I won that contest with the design below!

## 10th year AskReddit Anniversary
In 2018, I won a [AskReddit's 10th year anniversary t-shirt design contest!](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/celebrating-ten-years-of-r-askreddit). All funds for the shirt went towards Doctors Without Borders.
