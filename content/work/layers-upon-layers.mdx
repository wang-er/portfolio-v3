## project context
This was an assignment in my Information Design class at Northeastern University.

Our task was to visualize three different trips I've taken starting from my apartment in Boston. Our destination were three different places in varying distances:
1. To Northeastern University
2. To any location outside of MA, for me this was back to my family home back in Connecticut
3. To any location outside of the US – I chose my heritage country Taiwan.

Not only did we have to document the ways we got there, but also 10 other pieces of information such as the time, activities, food, entertainment and emotions.
